Think of it this way: when a digital product is easier for someone with visual, auditory, or motor challenges to use, it becomes easier for everyone to use. Clearer text contrast, better voice navigation, and simpler layouts don't just help a small group — they enhance usability for the entire audience."}),e.jsx("p",{className:"leading-relaxed",style:{color:"var(--text-secondary)"},children:"And users notice.
